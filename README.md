### Bitwise Operator
##### For jersey 1 & 2
A simple C++ program that will check if a pixel belongs to a Patriots jersey or not. Patriots jersey have the color BLUE, but not the Falcons. If it is a Patriots jersey, print Patriots, otherwise prints Falcons. It must be implemented using bitwise operations.

##### For jersey 3 & 4
It will check to see if the pixel is blank/white (no colors), using only bitwise operation and the constants already defined. You must print 'Blank', 'Not Blank' for jersey3 and jersey4.
